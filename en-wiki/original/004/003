[ 2 ] It encompasses one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United Kingdom and comprises ten metropolitan boroughs : Bolton , Bury , Oldham , Rochdale , Stockport , Tameside , Trafford , Wigan , and the cities of Manchester and Salford . Greater Manchester was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 . Greater Manchester spans 493 square miles (1,277 km 2 ). [ 3 ] It is landlocked and borders Cheshire (to the south-west and south), Derbyshire (to the south-east), West Yorkshire (to the north-east), Lancashire (to the north) and Merseyside (to the west). There is a mix of high density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester, but overwhelmingly the land use is urban. It has a focused central business district, formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford, but Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts, each of which has at least one major town centre and outlying suburbs. The Greater Manchester Urban Area is the third most populous conurbation in the UK , and spans across most of the county's territory. For the 12 years following 1974 the county had a two-tier system of local government; district councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council . The county council was abolished in 1986, and so its districts (the metropolitan boroughs) effectively became unitary authority areas . However, the metropolitan county has continued to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference, [ 4 ] and as a ceremonial county , has a Lord Lieutenant and a High Sheriff . Several county-wide services were co-ordinated through the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities up until April 2011, when the Greater Manchester Combined Authority was established as the strategic county-wide authority for Greater Manchester, taking on functions and responsibilities for economic development, regeneration and transport. Before the creation of the metropolitan county, the name SELNEC was used for the area, taken from the initials of "South East Lancashire North East Cheshire". Greater Manchester is an amalgamation of 70 former local government districts from the former administrative counties of Lancashire , Cheshire , the West Riding of Yorkshire and eight independent county boroughs .

There is evidence of Iron Age inhabitation, particularly at Mellor , [ 6 ] and Celtic activity in a settlement named Chochion , believed to have been an area of Wigan settled by the Brigantes . [ 7 ] Stretford was also part of the land believed to have been occupied by the Celtic Brigantes tribe, and lay on their border with the Cornovii on the southern side of the River Mersey . [ 8 ] The remains of 1st century forts at Castlefield in Manchester, [ 9 ] and Castleshaw Roman fort in Saddleworth , [ 10 ] are evidence of Roman occupation . Much of the region was omitted from the Domesday Book of 1086; Redhead states that this was because only a partial survey was taken, rather than sparsity of population. [ 11 ] Former weavers' cottages in Wardle . The development of Greater Manchester is attributed to a shared tradition of domestic cloth production, and textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution . During the Middle Ages , much of what became Greater Manchester lay within the hundred of Salfordshire – an ancient division of the county of Lancashire . Salfordshire encompassed several parishes and townships , some of which, like Rochdale , were important market towns and centres of England's woollen trade. The development of what became Greater Manchester is attributed to a shared tradition of domestic flannel and fustian cloth production, which encouraged a system of cross-regional trade. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The Industrial Revolution transformed the local domestic system, and much of Greater Manchester's heritage is related to textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and the infrastructure that grew up to support this sector. [ 14 ] The townships in and around Manchester began expanding "at an astonishing rate" around the turn of the 19th century as part of a process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by a boom in textile processing. [ 15 ] Places such as Bury , Oldham and Bolton played a central economic role in the nation, and by the end of the 19th century had become some of the most important and productive mill towns in the world. [ 16 ] However, it was Manchester that was the most populous settlement, a major city and the world's largest marketplace for cotton goods. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] By 1835 "Manchester was without challenge the first and greatest industrial city in the world", [ 18 ] and due to its commercial and socio-economic success the need for local government and geo-administrative reform for the region in and around the city was proposed in as early as the 1910s. [ 19 ] By the 18th century, traders from Germany had coined the name Manchesterthum , meaning "Greater Manchester", and were using that as a name for the region in and around Manchester. [ 20 ] However, the English term "Greater Manchester" did not appear until the 20th century. One of its first known recorded uses was in a 1914 report put forward in response to what was considered to have been the successful creation of the County of London in 1889. [ 19 ] The report suggested that a county should be set up to recognise the "Manchester known in commerce", and referred to the areas that formed "a substantial part of South Lancashire and part of Cheshire, comprising all municipal boroughs and minor authorities within a radius of eight or nine miles of Manchester". [ 19 ] [ 21 ] In his 1915 book Cities In Evolution , urban planner Sir Patrick Geddes wrote "far more than Lancashire realises, is growing up another Greater London". [ 22 ] Greater Manchester lies at the conjunction of the ancient county boundaries of Cheshire , Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire . Conurbations in England tend to build up at the historic county boundaries [ 23 ] and Greater Manchester is no exception. Most of Greater Manchester lay within the ancient county boundaries of Lancashire ; those areas south of the Mersey and Tame were in Cheshire . The Saddleworth area and a small part of Mossley are historically part of Yorkshire and in the south-east a small part in Derbyshire . The areas that were incorporated into Greater Manchester in 1974 previously formed parts of the administrative counties of Cheshire, Lancashire, the West Riding of Yorkshire and of eight independent county boroughs . [ 5 ] By the early 1970s, this system of demarcation was described as "archaic" and "grossly inadequate to keep pace both with the impact of motor travel, and with the huge increases in local government responsibilities". [ 24 ] The Manchester Evening Chronicle brought to the fore the issue of "regional unity" for the area in April 1935 under the headline "Greater Manchester – The Ratepayers' Salvation". It reported on the "increasing demands for the exploration of the possibilities of a greater merger of public services throughout Manchester and the surrounding municipalities". [ 25 ] The issue was frequently discussed by civic leaders in the area at that time, particularly those from Manchester and Salford . The Mayor of Salford pledged his support to the idea, stating that he looked forward to the day when "there would be a merging of the essential services of Manchester, Salford, and the surrounding districts constituting Greater Manchester." [ 25 ] Proposals were halted by the Second World War, though in the decade after it, the pace of proposals for local government reform for the area quickened. [ 26 ] In 1947, Lancashire County Council proposed a three " ridings " system to meet the changing needs of the county of Lancashire, including those for Manchester and surrounding districts. [ 26 ] Other proposals included the creation of a Manchester County Council, a directly elected regional body. In 1951, the census in the UK began reporting on South East Lancashire as a homogeneous conurbation. [ 26 ] [ edit ] Redcliffe-Maud Report Further information: Redcliffe-Maud Report The Local Government Act 1958 designated the south east Lancashire area (which, despite its name, included part of north east Cheshire), a Special Review Area. The Local Government Commission for England presented draft recommendations, in December 1965, proposing a new county based on the conurbation surrounding and including Manchester, with nine most-purpose boroughs corresponding to the modern Greater Manchester boroughs (excluding Wigan). The review was abolished in favour of the Royal Commission on Local Government before issuing a final report. [ 27 ] The Royal Commission's 1969 report, known as the Redcliffe-Maud Report, proposed the removal of much of the then existing system of local government. The commission described the system of administering urban and rural districts separately as outdated, noting that urban areas provided employment and services for rural dwellers, and open countryside was used by town dwellers for recreation. The commission considered interdependence of areas at many levels, including travel-to-work, provision of services, and which local newspapers were read, before proposing a new administrative metropolitan area . [ 28 ] The area had roughly the same northern boundary as today's Greater Manchester (though included Rossendale ), but covered much more territory from Cheshire (including Macclesfield , Warrington , Alderley Edge , Northwich , Middlewich , Wilmslow and Lymm ), and Derbyshire (the towns of New Mills , Whaley Bridge , Glossop and Chapel-en-le-Frith – a minority report suggested that Buxton be included). [ 29 ] The metropolitan area was to be divided into nine metropolitan districts, based on Wigan, Bolton, Bury/Rochdale, Warrington, Manchester (including Salford and Old Trafford), Oldham, Altrincham, Stockport and Tameside. [ 29 ] The report noted "The choice even of a label of convenience for this metropolitan area is difficult". [ 30 ] Seven years earlier, a survey prepared for the British Association intended to define the "South-East Lancashire conurbation" noted that "Greater Manchester it is not ... One of its main characteristics is the marked individuality of its towns, ... all of which have an industrial and commercial history of more than local significance". [ 31 ] The term Selnec (or SELNEC ) was already in use as an abbreviation for south east Lancashire and north east Cheshire; Redcliffe-Maud took this as "the most convenient term available", having modified it to south east Lancashire, north east and central Cheshire. [ 29 ] Following the Transport Act 1968 , in 1969 the SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive (an authority to co-ordinate and operate public transport in the region) was set up, covering an area smaller than the proposed Selnec, and different again to the eventual Greater Manchester. Compared with the Redcliffe-Maud area, it excluded Macclesfield, Warrington, and Knutsford but included Glossop and Saddleworth in the West Riding of Yorkshire . It excluded Wigan, which was in both the Redcliffe-Maud area and in the eventual Greater Manchester (but had not been part of the 1958 act's review area). [ 32 ] Redcliffe-Maud's recommendations were accepted by the Labour-controlled government in February 1970. [ 33 ] Although the Redcliffe-Maud Report was rejected by the Conservative government after the 1970 general election , there was a commitment to local government reform, and the need for a metropolitan county centred on the conurbation surrounding Manchester was accepted. The new government's original proposal was much smaller than the Redcliffe-Maud Report's Selnec, with areas such as Winsford, Northwich, Knutsford, Macclesfield and Glossop retained by their original counties to ensure their county councils had enough revenue to remain competitive ( Cheshire County Council would have ceased to exist). [ 33 ] Other late changes included the separation of the proposed Bury/Rochdale authority (retained from the Redcliffe-Maud report) into the Metropolitan Borough of Bury and the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale . Bury and Rochdale were originally planned to form a single district (dubbed "Botchdale" by local MP Michael Fidler ) [ 34 ] [ 35 ] but were divided into separate boroughs. To re-balance the districts, the borough of Rochdale took Middleton from Oldham. [ 36 ] During the passage of the bill, the towns of Whitworth , Wilmslow and Poynton successfully objected to their incorporation in the new county.

Stockport Bus Station in 1988. Greater Manchester Transport operated bus services throughout the county, from 1974 to 1993. GMC County Hall (now known as Westminster House) in Manchester housed the Greater Manchester County Council until its abolition in 1986. The Local Government Act 1972 reformed local government in England by creating a system of two-tier metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties and districts throughout the country. [ 37 ] The act formally established Greater Manchester on 1 April 1974, although Greater Manchester County Council (GMCC) had been running since elections in 1973 . [ 39 ] The leading article in The Times on the day the Local Government Act came into effect noted that the "new arrangement is a compromise which seeks to reconcile familiar geography which commands a certain amount of affection and loyalty, with the scale of operations on which modern planning methods can work effectively". [ 40 ] Frangopulo noted that the creation of Greater Manchester "was the official unifying of a region which, through history and tradition, had forged for itself over many centuries bonds ... between the communities of town and village, each of which was the embodiment of the character of this region". [ 41 ] The name Greater Manchester was adopted, having been favoured over Selnec by the local population. [ 42 ] By January 1974, a joint working party representing Greater Manchester had drawn up its county Structure Plan , ready for implementation by the Greater Manchester County Council. The plan set out objectives for the forthcoming metropolitan county. [ 43 ] The highest priority was to increase the quality of life for its inhabitants by improving the county's physical environment and cultural facilities which had suffered following deindustrialisation—much of Greater Manchester's basic infrastructure dated from its 19th-century growth, and was unsuited to modern lifestyles. [ 44 ] Other objectives were to reverse the trend of depopulation in central-Greater Manchester, to invest in country parks to improve the region's poor reputation on leisure facilities, and to improve the county's transport infrastructure and patterns. [ 45 ] Because of political objection, particularly from Cheshire, Greater Manchester covered only the inner, urban 62 of the 90 former districts that the Royal Commission had outlined as an effective administrative metropolitan area. [ 46 ] In this capacity, GMCC found itself "planning for an arbitrary metropolitan area ... abruptly truncated to the south", and so had to negotiate several land-use, transport and housing projects with its neighbouring county councils. [ 46 ] However a "major programme of environmental action" by GMCC broadly succeeded in reversing social deprevation in its inner city slums. [ 46 ] Leisure and recreational successes included the Greater Manchester Exhibition Centre (better known as the G-Mex centre and now branded Manchester Central ), a converted former railway station in Manchester city centre used for cultural events, [ 47 ] and GMCC's creation of five new country parks within its boundaries. [ 48 ] GMCC was, however, criticised for being too Manchester-centric by representatives from the outer suburbs. [ 49 ] Unlike most other modern counties (including Merseyside and Tyne and Wear ), Greater Manchester was never adopted as a postal county by the Royal Mail . A review in 1973 noted that "Greater Manchester" would be unlikely to be adopted because of confusion with the Manchester post town . [ 50 ] The component areas of Greater Manchester held on to their pre-1974 postal counties until 1996, when they were abolished. [ 51 ] Many in the conurbation do however continue to include the old county names in their postal addresses. A decade after they were established, the mostly Labour -controlled metropolitan county councils and the Greater London Council (GLC) had several high profile clashes with the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher , with regards overspending and high rates charging. Government policy on the issue was considered throughout 1982, and the Conservative Party put a "promise to scrap the metropolitan county councils" and the GLC, in their manifesto for the 1983 general election . [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Greater Manchester County Council was abolished on 31 March 1986 under the Local Government Act 1985 . That the metropolitan county councils were controlled by the Labour Party led to accusations that their abolition was motivated by party politics: [ 52 ] the general secretary of the National Association of Local Government Officers described it as a "completely cynical manoeuvre". [ 54 ] Most of the functions of GMCC were devolved to the ten Greater Manchester metropolitan district councils, though functions such as emergency services and public transport were taken over by joint boards and continued to be run on a county-wide basis. [ 55 ] The Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA) was established to continue much of the county-wide services of the county council . [ 56 ] The metropolitan county continues to exist in law, and as a geographic frame of reference, [ 4 ] for example as a NUTS 2 administrative division for statistical purposes within the European Union . [ 57 ] Although having been a Lieutenancy area since 1974, Greater Manchester was included as a ceremonial county by the Lieutenancies Act 1997 on 1 July 1997. [ 58 ] [ edit ] Combined Authority Further information: Manchester City Region and Greater Manchester Combined Authority In 1998, the people of Greater London voted in a referendum in favour of establishing a new Greater London Authority , with mayor and an elected chamber for the county. [ 59 ] The New Local Government Network proposed the creation of a new Manchester City Region based on Greater Manchester and other metropolitan counties as part of on-going reform efforts, while a report released by the Institute for Public Policy Research 's Centre for Cities proposed the creation of two administrative city regions based on Manchester and Birmingham . In July 2007, The Treasury published its Review of sub-national economic development and regeneration , which stated that the government would allow those city regions that wished to work together to form a statutory framework for city regional activity, including powers over transport, skills, planning and economic development. [ 60 ] In January 2008, AGMA suggested that a formal government structure be created to cover Greater Manchester. [ 61 ] The issue resurfaced in June 2008 with regards to proposed congestion charging in Greater Manchester ; Sir Richard Leese (leader of Manchester City Council ) said "I've come to the conclusion that [a referendum on congestion charging should be held] because we don't have an indirectly or directly elected body for Greater Manchester that has the power to make this decision". [ 62 ] On 14 July 2008 the ten local authorities in Greater Manchester agreed to a strategic and integrated cross-county Multi-Area Agreement ; a voluntary initiative aimed at making district councils "work together to challenge the artificial limits of boundaries" in return for greater autonomy from the central government of the UK . [ 63 ] A referendum on the Greater Manchester Transport Innovation Fund was held in December 2008, [ 64 ] in which voters "overwhelmingly rejected" plans for public transport improvements linked to a peak-time weekday-only congestion charge. [ 65 ] Following a bid from AGMA highlighting the potential benefits in combatting the late-2000s financial crisis , it was announced in the 2009 United Kingdom Budget that Greater Manchester and the Leeds City Region would be awarded Statutory City Region Pilot status, allowing (if they desired) for their constituent district councils to pool resources and become statutory Combined Authorities with powers comparable to the Greater London Authority. [ 66 ] The stated aim of the pilot was to evaluate the contributions to economic growth and sustainable development by Combined Authorities. [ 67 ] The Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 enabled the creation of a Combined Authority for Greater Manchester with devolved powers on public transport, skills, housing, regeneration, waste management, carbon neutrality and planning permission , pending approval from the ten councils. [ 66 ] [ 68 ] Such strategic matters would be decided on via an enhanced majority rule voting system involving ten members appointed from among the councillors of the metropolitan boroughs (one representing each borough with each council nominating one substitute) without the input of central government. The ten district councils of Greater Manchester approved the creation of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) on 29 March 2010, and submitted final recommendations for a constitution to the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Department for Transport . On 31 March 2010 the Communities Secretary John Denham approved the constitution and launched a 15 week public consultation on the draft bill together with the approved constitution. [ 69 ] Following requests by the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities, which was superseded by the GMCA, [ 70 ] [ 71 ] [ 72 ] the new authority came in to being on 1 April 2011. [ 73 ] On the same day, the Transport for Greater Manchester Committee was also formed from a pool of 33 councillors allocated by council population (roughly one councillor per 75,000 residents) to scrutinise the running of Greater Manchester's transport bodies and their finances, approve the decisions and policies of said bodies and form strategic policy recommendations or projects for the approval of the Combined Authority. [ 66 ] [ edit ] Geography Main articles: Geography of Greater Manchester and List of places in Greater Manchester An aerial photograph of Greater Manchester The Greater Manchester Urban Area , highlighted in red, against the boundaries of the Metropolitan County A view over the borough of Tameside , towards Manchester city centre . Greater Manchester is a landlocked county spanning 493 square miles (1,277 km 2 ). [ 3 ] The Pennines rise along the eastern side of the county, through parts of Oldham , Rochdale and Tameside . The West Pennine Moors and several coalfields (mainly sandstones and shales) lie in the west of the county. The rivers Mersey and Tame run through the county boundaries, both of which rise in the Pennines. Other rivers run through the county, including the Beal , the Douglas and the Irk . Black Chew Head is the highest point in Greater Manchester, rising 1,778 feet (542 m) above sea-level, within the parish of Saddleworth . [ 74 ] Chat Moss at 10.6 square miles (27 km 2 ) comprises the largest area of prime farmland in Greater Manchester and contains the largest block of semi-natural woodland in the county. [ 75 ] There is a mix of high density urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Greater Manchester, but overwhelmingly the land use in the county is urban. [ 76 ] It has a strong regional central business district, formed by Manchester city centre and the adjoining parts of Salford and Trafford . However, Greater Manchester is also a polycentric county with ten metropolitan districts, [ 76 ] each of which has a major town centre – and in some cases more than one – and many smaller settlements. Greater Manchester is arguably the most complex urban area in the UK outside London, [ 76 ] described as a "polycentric functional urban region", [ 49 ] and this is reflected in the density of its transport network and the scale of its needs for investment to meet the growing and diverse movement demands generated by its development pattern.

Its territory spans much, but not all of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. It excludes settlements such as Wigan and Marple from within the Greater Manchester county boundaries, but includes settlements which are outside of the county boundaries, such as Wilmslow and Alderley Edge in Cheshire, and Whitworth in Lancashire. Although neither the Greater Manchester county, nor the Greater Manchester Urban Area have been granted city status in the United Kingdom , European Union literature suggests that the conurbation surrounding Manchester constitutes a homogonous urban city region . [ 77 ] A view over Greater Manchester. The county is heavily urbanised and consists of vast built up areas and many settlements. [ edit ] Climate Greater Manchester experiences a temperate maritime climate , like most of the British Isles , with relatively cool summers and mild winters. The county's average annual rainfall is 806.6 millimetres (31.76 in) [ 78 ] compared to the UK average of 1,125.0 millimetres (44.29 in), [ 79 ] and its mean rain days are 140.4 mm (5.53 in) per annum, [ 78 ] compared to the UK average of 154.4 mm (6.08 in). [ 79 ] The mean temperature is slightly above average for the United Kingdom. [ 80 ] Greater Manchester also has a relatively high humidity level, which lent itself to the optimised and breakage-free textile manufacturing which took place around the county. Snowfall is not a common sight in the built up areas, due to the urban warming effect. However, the Pennine and Rossendale Forest hills around the eastern and northern edges of the county receive more snow, and roads leading out of the county can be closed due to heavy snowfall, [ 81 ] notably the A62 road via Standedge , the A57 ( Snake Pass ) towards Sheffield , [ 82 ] and the M62 over Saddleworth Moor . In the most southern point of Greater Manchester, Woodford's Met Office weather station recorded a temperature of −17.6 °C (0.3 °F) on 8 January 2010, during the Winter of 2009-2010 in the United Kingdom .

The authority derives most of its powers from the Local Government Act 2000 and Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Act 2009 , [ 86 ] and replaced a range of single-purpose joint boards and quangos in 2011, to provide a formal administrative authority for Greater Manchester with powers over public transport, skills, housing, regeneration, waste management, carbon neutrality and planning permission . [ 86 ] Functional executive bodies, such as Transport for Greater Manchester , are responsible for delivery of services in these areas. [ 86 ] Beneath the GMCA are the ten councils of Greater Manchester's ten districts , which are Bolton , Bury , the City of Manchester , Oldham , Rochdale , the City of Salford , Stockport , Tameside , Trafford and Wigan . These district councils have the greatest powers over public services, and control matters such as council tax , education provision, social housing, libraries and healthcare. Eight of the ten metropolitan boroughs were named after the eight former county boroughs that now compose the largest centres of population and greater historical and political prominence. [ 87 ] As an example, the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport is centred on the town of Stockport , a former county borough, but includes other smaller settlements, such as Cheadle , Gatley , and Bramhall . [ 87 ] The names of two of the metropolitan boroughs were given a neutral name because, at the time they were created, there was no agreement on the town to be put forward as the administrative centre and neither had a county borough . These boroughs are Tameside and Trafford , centred on Ashton-under-Lyne and Stretford , respectively, and are named with reference to geographical and historical origins. [ 87 ] The lowest formal tier of local government in Greater Manchester are the parish councils , which cover the various civil parishes in Greater Manchester , and have limited powers over upkeep, maintenance and small grants. For the first 12 years after the county was created in 1974, Greater Manchester had a two-tier system of local government, and the metropolitan borough councils shared power with the Greater Manchester County Council . [ 88 ] The Greater Manchester County Council, a strategic authority based in what is now Westminster House off Piccadilly Gardens , comprised 106 members drawn from the ten metropolitan boroughs of Greater Manchester. [ 89 ] It was a sub-regional body running regional services such as transport, strategic planning, emergency services and waste disposal. In 1986, along with the five other metropolitan county councils and the Greater London Council , the Greater Manchester County Council was abolished, and most of its powers were devolved to the boroughs. [ 88 ] Between 1986 and 2011, the boroughs were effectively unitary authority areas , but opted to co-operate voluntarily under the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA), which served to create a co-ordinated county-wide approach to issues of common interest to Greater Manchester, such as public transport and the shared labour market, as well as making representations to central government and the European Union. The politics of Greater Manchester have been characterised by "entrenched localism and related rivallries", historically resistant to regionalism ; Greater Manchester is administered by systems of "inter-municipal coordination" (some formal, some voluntary). [ 49 ] That eight of the ten borough councils have (for the most part) been Labour -controlled since 1986, has helped maintain informal co-operation between the districts at a county-level. [ 46 ] After the abolition of the county council, the ten authorities of Greater Manchester co-operated voluntarily on policy issues like Local Transport Plans as well as funding the Greater Manchester County Record Office , [ 90 ] and local services were administered by statutory joint boards . Now under the direction of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, these joint boards are Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) which is responsible for planning and co-ordinating public transport across the county; the Greater Manchester Police , who are overseen by a joint Police authority ; the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service , who are administered by a joint Fire and Rescue Authority; and the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority . These joint boards are made up of councillors appointed from each of the ten boroughs (except the Waste Disposal Authority, which does not include the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan ). The ten boroughs jointly own the Manchester Airport Group which controls Manchester Airport and three other UK airports. Other services are directly funded and managed by the local councils. [ 91 ] Greater Manchester is a ceremonial county with its own Lord-Lieutenant who is the personal representative of the monarch. The Local Government Act 1972 provided that the whole of the area to be covered by the new metropolitan county of Greater Manchester would also be included in the Duchy of Lancaster – extending the duchy to include areas which were formerly in the counties of Cheshire and the West Riding of Yorkshire. Until 31 March 2005, Greater Manchester's Keeper of the Rolls was appointed by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster ; they are now appointed by the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain . [ 92 ] The first Lord Lieutenant of Greater Manchester was Sir William Downward who held the title from 1974 to 1988. [ 93 ] The current Lord Lieutenant is Warren James Smith. [ 94 ] As a geographic county, Greater Manchester is used by the government (via the Office for National Statistics ) for the gathering of county-wide statistics, and organising and collating general register and census material. [ 95 ] In terms of representation in the Parliament of the United Kingdom , Greater Manchester is divided into 28 parliamentary constituencies – 18 borough constituencies and 10 county constituencies . Most of Greater Manchester is controlled by the Labour party , and is generally considered a Labour stronghold, [ 96 ] [ 97 ] with only four constituencies (since the 2010 General Election ) belonging to the Liberal Democrats , and two constituencies to the Conservative party .

It was at its peak in 1971, however, at 2.7M. Much of Greater Manchester's housing stock consists of terraced houses constructed as low-cost dwellings for the populations of local factory towns . This street in Salford has been renovated by Urban Splash . Greater Manchester has a population of 2,600,100 (as of 2009), making it the third most populous county in the United Kingdom (after Greater London and the West Midlands ). [ 98 ] It is the seventh most densely populated county of England. The demonym of Greater Manchester is "Greater Mancunian". [ 99 ] Greater Manchester is home to a diverse population and is a multicultural agglomeration with significant ethnic minority population comprising 8.5% of the total population. [ 100 ] [ 101 ] In 2008, there were over 66 refugee nationalities in the county. [ 102 ] As of the 2001 UK census, 74.2% of Greater Manchester's residents were Christian, 5.0% Muslim, 0.9% Jewish, 0.7% Hindu, 0.2% Buddhist, and 0.1% Sikh. 11.4% had no religion, 0.2% had an alternative religion and 7.4% did not state their religion. This is similar to the rest of the country, although the proportions of Muslims and Jews are nearly twice the national average. [ 103 ] It contains the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation , a large Ashkenazi Orthodox synagogue located in North Manchester. Greater Manchester is covered by the Roman Catholic Dioceses of Salford and Shrewsbury , [ 104 ] [ 105 ] and the Archdiocese of Liverpool . Most of Greater Manchester is part of the Anglican Diocese of Manchester , [ 106 ] apart from Wigan which lies within the Diocese of Liverpool . [ 107 ] Following the deindustrialisation of Greater Manchester in the mid-20th century, there was a significant economic and population decline in the region, particularly in Manchester and Salford. [ 108 ] [ 109 ] Vast areas of low-quality squalid terraced housing that were built throughout the Victorian era were found to be in a poor state of repair and unsuited to modern needs; many inner-city districts suffered from chronic social deprivation and high levels of unemployment. [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Slum clearance and the increased building of social housing overspill estates by Salford and Manchester City Councils lead to a decrease in population in central Greater Manchester. [ 111 ] During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, the population of Greater Manchester declined by over 8,000 inhabitants a year. [ 109 ] While Manchester's population shrank by about 40% during this time (from 766,311 in 1931 to 452,000 in 2006), the total population of Greater Manchester decreased by only 8%. [ 109 ] Population totals for Greater Manchester Year Population Year Population Year Population 1801 328,609 1871 1,590,102 1941 2,693,775 1811 409,464 1881 1,866,649 1951 2,688,987 1821 526,230 1891 2,125,318 1961 2,699,711 1831 700,486 1901 2,357,150 1971 2,729,741 1841 860,413 1911 2,617,598 1981 2,575,441 1851 1,037,001 1921 2,660,088 1991 2,569,700 1861 1,313,550 1931 2,707,070 2001 2,482,352 Pre-1974 statistics were gathered from local government areas that now comprise Greater Manchester Source: Great Britain Historical GIS . [ 112 ] Greater Manchester's housing stock comprises a variety of types. Manchester city centre is noted for its high-rise apartments, [ 113 ] while Salford has some of the tallest and most densely populated tower block estates in Europe. [ 114 ] Throughout Greater Manchester, rows of terraced houses are common, most of them built during the Victorian and Edwardian periods . In the 2000s, the Housing Market Renewal Initiative identified Manchester , Salford, Rochdale and Oldham as areas with terraced housing unsuited to modern needs. Although Greater Manchester has a reputation as an urban sprawl, the county does have areas of green belt . Altrincham , with its neighbours Bowdon and Hale , is said to constitute a "stockbroker belt, with well-appointed dwellings in an area of sylvan opulence". [ 115 ] [ edit ] Education See also: List of schools in Greater Manchester Greater Manchester has four universities: the University of Manchester , Manchester Metropolitan University , the University of Salford and the University of Bolton . Together with the Royal Northern College of Music they had a combined population of students in higher education of 101,165 in 2007 – the third highest number in England behind Greater London (360,890) and the West Midlands (140,980), [ 116 ] and the thirteenth highest in England per head of population. [ 117 ] The majority of students are concentrated on Oxford Road in Manchester, Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. [ 118 ] Primary, secondary and further education within Greater Manchester are the responsibility of the constituent boroughs which form local education authorities and administer schools and colleges of further education. The county is also home to independent schools such as St Bede's College , Manchester Grammar School , Stockport Grammar School , Bolton School and Bury Grammar School . [ edit ] Economy See also: List of companies based in Greater Manchester and Economy of Manchester Oldham , painted during the Industrial Revolution . Many towns in Greater Manchester were built around the mills. Salford Quays is the City of Salford 's main business district. The Trafford Centre is one of the largest shopping centres in the United Kingdom . Much of Greater Manchester's wealth was generated during the Industrial Revolution. The world's first cotton mill was built in the town of Royton , [ 119 ] [ 120 ] and the county encompasses several former mill towns . An Association for Industrial Archaeology publication describes Greater Manchester as "one of the classic areas of industrial and urban growth in Britain, the result of a combination of forces that came together in the 18th and 19th centuries: a phenomenal rise in population, the appearance of the specialist industrial town, a transport revolution, and weak local lordship". [ 14 ] Much of the county was at the forefront of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and into the early 20th century, represented by the former textile mills found throughout the county. [ 14 ] The territory that makes up Greater Manchester experienced a rapid decline of these traditional sectors, partly during the Lancashire Cotton famine brought on by the American Civil War , but mainly as part of the post-war economic depression and deindustrialisation of Britain that occurred during the 20th century. [ 109 ] Considerable industrial restructuring has helped the region to recover. [ 121 ] Historically, the docks at Salford Quays were an industrial port, though are now (following a period of disuse) a commercial and residential area which includes the Imperial War Museum North and The Lowry theatre and exhibition centre. The BBC is now established in their new home at MediaCityUK, at Salford Quays. This is home to BBC North West, several BBC departments, including BBC Sport, Blue Peter and, as of April 2012, BBC Breakfast. Today, Greater Manchester is the economic centre of the North West region of England and is the largest sub-regional economy in the UK outside London and South East England . [ 122 ] Greater Manchester represents more than £42 billion of the UK regional GVA , more than Wales, Northern Ireland or North East England . [ 123 ] Manchester city centre , the central business district of Greater Manchester, is a major centre of trade and commerce and provides Greater Manchester with a global identity, specialist activities and employment opportunities; similarly, the economy of the city centre is dependent upon the rest of the county for its population as an employment pool, skilled workforce and for its collective purchasing power. [ 124 ] Manchester today is a centre of the arts, the media, higher education and commerce. In a poll of British business leaders published in 2006, Manchester was regarded as the best place in the UK to locate a business. [ 125 ] A report commissioned by Manchester Partnership, published in 2007, showed Manchester to be the "fastest-growing city" economically. [ 126 ] It is the third most visited city in the United Kingdom by foreign visitors [ 127 ] and is now often considered to be the second city of the UK . [ 128 ] The Trafford Centre is one of the largest shopping centres in the United Kingdom , and is located within the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford . As of the 2001 UK census, there were 1,805,315 residents of Greater Manchester aged 16 to 74. The economic activity of these people was 40.3% in full-time employment, 11.3% in part-time employment, 6.7% self-employed, 3.5% unemployed, 5.1% students without jobs, 2.6% students with jobs, 13.0% retired, 6.1% looking after home or family, 7.8% permanently sick or disabled and 3.5% economically inactive for other reasons. The figures follow the national trend, although the percentage of self-employed people is below the national average of 8.3%. [ 129 ] The proportion of unemployment in the county varies, with the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport having the lowest at 2.0% and Manchester the highest at 7.9%. [ 130 ] In 2001, of the 1,093,385 residents of Greater Manchester in employment, the industry of employment was: 18.4% retail and wholesale; 16.7% manufacturing; 11.8% property and business services; 11.6% health and social work; 8.0% education; 7.3% transport and communications; 6.7% construction; 4.9% public administration and defence; 4.7% hotels and restaurants; 4.1% finance; 0.8% electricity, gas, and water supply; 0.5% agriculture; and 4.5% other. This was roughly in line with national figures, except for the proportion of jobs in agriculture which is only about a third of the national average of 1.5%, due to the overwhelmingly urban, built-up land use of Greater Manchester.

A Metrolink tram bound for Eccles , part of Greater Manchester's light rail public transport system First Manchester operate bus services in northern-Greater Manchester. Public transport services in Greater Manchester are co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM), a public body with powers between those of a passenger transport executive and Transport for London , [ 134 ] established as SELNEC PTE in 1969 in accordance with the Transport Act 1968 . [ 135 ] The original SELNEC Passenger Transport Authority was renamed as the Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE) when taken over by the Greater Manchester County Council on 1 April 1974 in order to co-ordinate bus and rail services within the new county. [ 135 ] The council had overall responsibility for strategic planning and all policy decisions covering public transport and highways. GMPTE's purpose was to secure the provision of a completely integrated and efficient system of passenger transport to meet the needs of its area. [ 135 ] In 1977, it was noted as the largest authority for public transport in the United Kingdom after London Transport . [ 135 ] GMPTE was renamed as Transport for Greater Manchester in April 2011 when it became a functional body of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority and obtained powers additional to those of a regular passenger transport executive from central government. [ 134 ] Greater Manchester lies at the heart of the North West transport network. Much of the infrastructure converges at Manchester city centre with the Manchester Inner Ring Road , an amalgamation of several major roads, circulating the city centre. The county is the only place in the UK to have a fully orbital motorway , [ 136 ] the M60 , which passes through all of the boroughs except Bolton and Wigan. Greater Manchester has a higher percentage of the motorway network than any other county in the country, [ 137 ] and according to the Guinness Book of World Records , it has the most traffic lanes side by side (17), spread across several parallel carriageways ( M61 at Linnyshaw in Walkden , close to the M60 interchange). [ 138 ] Greater Manchester's 85 miles (137 km) of motorway network saw 5.8 billion vehicle kilometres in 2002 – about 6% of the UK's total, or 89,000 vehicles a day. [ 136 ] The A580 "East Lancs" road is a primary A road that connects Manchester and Salford with Liverpool . It was the UK's first purpose-built intercity highway and was officially opened by King George V on 18 July 1934. [ 139 ] Throughout 2008, there were proposals for congestion charging in Greater Manchester . [ 140 ] [ 141 ] Unlike the London scheme , two cordons would have been used, one covering the main urban core of the Greater Manchester Urban Area and another covering Manchester city centre. [ 142 ] There is an extensive bus network which radiates from Manchester city centre. The largest providers are First Manchester for the northern parts of the county and Stagecoach Manchester for the southern parts. In addition to the network of bus routes, a light rail system began operating in 1992 called Metrolink . The tram system serves Manchester, the City of Salford , Bury and Trafford . An expansion of the system is due to begin in 2008 which should in time see the system run to all boroughs except Bolton and Wigan. Greater Manchester has a rail network of 142 route miles (229 km) with 98 stations , forming a central hub to the North West rail network. [ 143 ] Train services are provided by private operators and run on the national rail network which is owned and managed by Network Rail . An extensive canal network also remains from the Industrial Revolution. Manchester Airport , which is the fourth busiest in the United Kingdom, serves the county and wider region with flights to more worldwide destinations than any other airport in the UK. [ 144 ] Since June 2007 it has served 225 routes. [ 145 ] The airport handled 21.06  million passengers in 2008. The three modes of public surface transport in the area are heavily used. 19.7 million rail journeys were made in the then GMPTE-supported area in the 2005/2006 financial year – an increase of 9.4% over 2004/2005; there were 19.9 million journeys on Metrolink; and the bus system carried 219.4 million passengers.

The main entrance of Old Trafford Cricket Ground The City of Manchester Stadium , the main venue of the 2002 Commonwealth Games and home to Manchester City F.C. Manchester hosted the 2002 Commonwealth Games which was, at a cost of £200M for the sporting facilities and a further £470M for local infrastructure, by far the biggest and most expensive sporting event held in the UK and the first to be an integral part of urban regeneration. [ 146 ] A mix of new and existing facilities were used. New amenities included the Manchester Aquatics Centre , Bolton Arena , the National Squash Centre , and the City of Manchester Stadium . The Manchester Velodrome was built as part of the bid to hold the 2000 Olympic Games . [ 147 ] After the Commonwealth Games the City of Manchester Stadium was converted for football use, and the adjacent warm-up track upgraded to become the Manchester Regional Arena . [ 148 ] Other facilities continue to be used by elite athletes. [ 146 ] Cambridge Policy Consultants estimate 4,500 full-time jobs as a direct consequence, and Grattan points to other long-term benefits accruing from publicity and the improvement of the area's image. [ 146 ] The Manchester Football Association is the governing body for association football in Greater Manchester, and is committed to promoting the sport throughout the county. [ 149 ] Four of its teams played in the 2010–11 Premier League . Manchester United F.C. are one of the world's best-known football teams, and in April 2008 Forbes estimated that they were the world's richest club. [ 150 ] They have won the League Championship a record nineteen times, the FA Cup a record eleven times, the Football League Cup four times and have been European Champions three times. [ 151 ] Their Old Trafford ground has hosted the FA Cup Final England international matches and the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final between Juventus and A.C. Milan . Manchester City F.C. moved from Maine Road to the City of Manchester Stadium after the 2002 Commonwealth Games. They have won the league championship twice and the FA Cup four times. [ 152 ] [ 153 ] Bolton Wanderers F.C. have won the FA cup four times. [ 152 ] Wigan Athletic F.C. are one of the league's younger sides, and have yet to win a major title. [ 154 ] In addition, Oldham Athletic A.F.C. (founding members of Premier League ) and Rochdale A.F.C. who play in League One ; there are also Bury F.C. (two FA Cup wins) and Stockport County F.C. who play in League Two . In rugby league , the Wigan Warriors and the Salford City Reds compete in the Super League , the top-level professional rugby league football club competition in Europe. Wigan have won the Super League/ Championship eighteen times, the Challenge Cup seventeen times, and the World Club Challenge three times. [ 155 ] Leigh Centurions and the Rochdale Hornets take part in the Championship , the sport's second tier, with Oldham Roughyeds and local rivals Swinton Lions in the third-tier Championship 1 . In rugby union , Stockport's Sale Sharks compete in the Guinness Premiership , and won the league in 2006. [ 156 ] Whitefield based Sedgley Park RUFC compete in National Division One , Manchester RUFC in National Division Two and Wigan side Orrell R.U.F.C. in National Division Three North . Lancashire County Cricket Club began as Manchester Cricket Club and represents the ( ancient ) county of Lancashire. Lancashire contested the original 1890 County Championship . The team has won the County Championship eight times, and in 2007 finished third, narrowly missing their first title since 1950. [ 157 ] Their Old Trafford ground, near the football stadium of the same name, regularly hosts test matches . Possibly the most famous took place in 1956, when Jim Laker took a record nineteen wickets in the fourth test against Australia . [ 158 ] Cheshire County Cricket Club are a minor counties club who sometimes play in the south of the county. [ 159 ] The Kirkmanshulme Lane stadium in Belle Vue is the home to top-flight speedway team the Belle Vue Aces and regular greyhound racing. Professional ice hockey returned to the area in early 2007 with the opening of a purpose-designed rink in Altrincham , the Altrincham Ice Dome , to host the Manchester Phoenix . Their predecessor, Manchester Storm , went out of business in 2002 because of financial problems that led to them being unable to pay players' wages or the rent for the Manchester Evening News Arena in which they played. [ 160 ] [ 161 ] Horse racing has taken place at several sites in the county. The two biggest courses were both known as Manchester Racecourse – though neither was within the boundaries of Manchester – and ran from the 17th century until 1963. Racing was at Kersal Moor until 1847 when the racecourse at Castle Irwell was opened. In 1867 racing was moved to New Barnes, Weaste , until the site was vacated (for a hefty price) in 1901 to allow an expansion to Manchester Docks . The land is now home to Dock 9 of the re-branded Salford Quays . Racing then moved back to Castle Irwell which later staged a Classic – the 1941 St. Leger – and was home to the Lancashire Oaks (nowadays run at Haydock Park ) and the November Handicap , which was traditionally the last major race of the flat season. Through the late 50s and early 60s the track saw Scobie Breasley and Lester Piggott annually battle out the closing acts of the jockey's title until racing ceased on 7 November 1963. [ 162 ] The Greater Manchester Athletics Association is the governing body of athletics in Greater Manchester, and organises events and competitions within Greater Manchester. [ 163 ] Professional athletics takes place at the Regional Athletics Arena in Sportcity , which has hosted numerous national trials, Robin Park in Wigan, Longford Park in Stretford (home to Trafford Athletic Club), Woodbank Stadium in Stockport (home to Stockport Harriers) and the Cleavleys Track in Winton (home to Salford Harriers). As of 2008, new sports facilities including a 10,000 capacity stadium and athletics venue are being constructed at Leigh Sports Village . [ 164 ] The Greater Manchester Community Basketball Club is an association which represents Greater Manchester in basketball. [ 165 ] It supports a variety of teams, including Manchester Magic . [ 166 ] The Greater Manchester County Crown Green Bowling Association appoints Junior, Senior and Veteran teams to represent Greater Manchester in the sport of bowls . [ 167 ] [ 168 ] Founded by Greater Manchester's ten district councils in 1996, GreaterSport is the County Sports Partnership for Greater Manchester which works closely with the sports and physical activity sectors and coordinates events such as the Greater Manchester Youth Games. [ 169 ] The Greater Manchester Sports Fund aims to ensure that people in Greater Manchester aged 12–21 competing in any kind of sport, irrespective of background, are able to obtain grants of up to £750 so that they can better fulfil their potential. [ 170 ] [ edit ] Culture The Lowry is a combined theatre and exhibition centre at Salford Quays , and is Greater Manchester's most visited tourist attraction. [ 171 ] The Imperial War Museum North in Trafford Park was designed by Daniel Libeskind , and is one of the Imperial War Museum's five branches. Art, tourism, culture and sport provide 16% of employment in Greater Manchester. The proportion is highest in Manchester. [ 172 ] Launched in 2004 by the Guardian Media Group , Channel M is a television station that broadcast local news and content about Greater Manchester. [ 173 ] It effectively closed in 2010. [ 174 ] In January 2011 Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt stated that a new Greater Manchester channel will be available on Freeview by around 2013. [ 175 ] Greater Manchester has the highest number of theatre seats per head of population outside London. Most, if not all, of the larger theatres are subsidised by local authorities or the North West Regional Arts Board. [ 176 ] The Royal Exchange Theatre formed in the 1970s out of a peripatetic group staging plays at venues such as at the University [of Manchester] Theatre and the Apollo Theatre . A season in a temporary stage in the former Royal Exchange, Manchester was followed by funding for a theatre in the round , which opened in 1976. [ 177 ] The Lowry — Greater Manchester's most visited tourist attraction [ 171 ] — houses two theatres, used by travelling groups in all the performing arts. [ 172 ] [ 178 ] The Opera House is a 1,900-seat venue hosting travelling productions, often musicals just out of the West End. [ 179 ] Its sister venue, The Palace , hosts generally similar shows. The Oldham Playhouse, one of the older theatres in the region, helped launch the careers of Stan Laurel and Charlie Chaplin . Its productions are described by the 2007 CityLife guide as 'staunchly populist' – and popular. [ 179 ] There are many other venues scattered throughout the county, of all types and sizes. [ 179 ] Art galleries in the county include: Gallery Oldham , which has in the past featured work by Pablo Picasso ; [ 180 ] The Lowry at Salford Quays, which has a changing display of L. S. Lowry 's work alongside travelling exhibitions; Manchester Art Gallery , a major provincial art gallery noted for its collection of Pre-Raphaelite art and housed in a Grade I listed building by Charles Barry ; [ 181 ] Salford Museum and Art Gallery , a local museum with a recreated Victorian street; [ 182 ] and Whitworth Art Gallery , a broad-based gallery now run by the University of Manchester. Greater Manchester has four professional orchestras, all based in Manchester. The Hallé Orchestra is the UK's oldest extant symphony orchestra (and the fourth oldest in the world), [ 183 ] supports a choir and a youth orchestra, and releases its recordings on its own record label. [ 184 ] The Hallé is based at the Bridgwater Hall but often tours, typically giving 70 performances "at home" and 40 on tour. [ 184 ] The BBC Philharmonic Orchestra , one of five BBC orchestras, can trace its history back to the early days of radio broadcasting in 1926. [ 185 ] As of 2008 it is based at the BBC's Oxford Road studios, [ 186 ] but is expected to move to MediaCityUK in Salford. [ 187 ] The Manchester Camerata and the Northern Chamber Orchestra are smaller, though still professional, organisations. [ 188 ] The main classical venue is the 2,341-seat Bridgewater Hall in Manchester, opened in 1996 at a cost of £42M. [ 189 ] Manchester is also a centre for musical education, via the Royal Northern College of Music and Chetham's School of Music .

[ 193 ] The Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester , amongst other displays, charts the rise of science and industry and especially the part Manchester played in its development; the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council described the displays as "pre-eminent collections of national and international importance". [ 194 ] Urbis began its life as a museum of the modern city, which attempted to explain the effects and experiences of life in the city. It was then transformed into an exhibition centre, which had its most successful year in 2006. Urbis is now preparing to enter its third phase since opening in 2002, as the National Football Museum. [ 195 ] Stockport Air Raid Shelters uses a mile of underground tunnels, built to accommodate 6,500 people, to illustrate life in the Second World War's air raid shelters.

[ 200 ] Manchester United, Manchester City, and Lancashire CCC all have dedicated museums illustrating their histories. Wigan Pier , best known from George Orwell 's book The Road to Wigan Pier , [ 201 ] was the name of a wharf on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal in Wigan .
