Green State Airport (Providence, RI) – PVD (Regional/State) Website http://www.providenceri.com Providence is the capital and most populous city of the state of Rhode Island and was one of the first cities established in the United States. [ 3 ] Located in Providence County , it is the third largest city in the New England region. The city proper population of 178,042 anchors the 37th largest metropolitan population in the country, with an estimated MSA population of 1,600,856, exceeding that of Rhode Island by about 60% due to its reaching into southern Massachusetts . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] This MSA in turn is part of the larger Greater Boston commuting area, which contains 7.6 million people. Situated at the mouth of the Providence River , at the head of Narragansett Bay , the city's small footprint is crisscrossed by seemingly erratic streets and contains a rapidly changing demographic. Providence was founded in 1636 by Roger Williams , a religious exile from the Massachusetts Bay Colony . He named the area in honor of "God's merciful Providence" which he believed was responsible for revealing such a haven for him and his followers to settle. After being one of the first cities in the country to industrialize, Providence became noted for its jewelry and silverware industry. Today, the City of Providence is home to eight hospitals and seven institutions of higher learning, which has shifted the city's economy into service industries, though it still retains significant manufacturing activity. Once nicknamed the "Beehive of Industry", Providence began rebranding itself as the "Creative Capital" in 2009 to emphasize its educational resources and arts community. [ 7 ] Its previous moniker was "The Renaissance City", although its 2009 poverty rate was still over 22%.

[ 11 ] Although the west bank of the Providence River was later claimed by both the English and the Dutch, the actual inhabitants and true masters of the region were the Pokanoket Tribe of the Wampanoag Nation led by Massasoit Ousamequin. [ 12 ] Williams secured permission to settle from the Pokanoket and gave the city its present name. [ 13 ] Williams' Providence soon became a refuge for persecuted religious dissenters, as he himself had been exiled from Massachusetts . [ 14 ] Providence's growth would be slow during the next quarter-century—the subsuming of its territory into surrounding towns, difficulty of farming the land, and differing of local traditions and land conflicts all slowed development. [ 14 ] In the mid-1770s, the British government levied taxes that impeded Providence's maritime, fishing and agricultural industries, the mainstay of the city's economy. One example was the Sugar Act , which was a tax levied against Providence's distilleries that adversely affected its trade in rum and slaves . These taxes caused Providence to join the other colonies in renouncing allegiance to the British Crown. In response to enforcement of unpopular trade laws, Providence residents spilled blood in the leadup to the American Revolution in the notorious Gaspée Affair of 1772. [ 14 ] Though during the American Revolutionary War the city escaped British occupation, the capture of nearby Newport disrupted industry and kept the population on alert. Troops were quartered for various campaigns and Brown University 's University Hall was used as a barracks and military hospital. [ 14 ] NPS map of the W3R Route After departing from Newport , French troops sent by King Louis XVI and commanded by the Comte de Rochambeau passed through Providence on their way to join the attack against British forces. The march from Newport to Providence was the beginning of a campaign led jointly by Rochambeau and General George Washington in a decisive march that ended with the defeat of General Cornwallis in the Siege of Yorktown at Yorktown, Virginia and the Battle of the Chesapeake . Following the war, Providence was the country's ninth-largest city b[›] [ 14 ] with 7,614 people. The economy shifted from maritime endeavors to manufacturing, particularly machinery, tools, silverware, jewelry and textiles. By the turn of the twentieth century, Providence boasted some of the largest manufacturing plants in the country, including Brown & Sharpe , Nicholson File, and Gorham Silverware . The city's industries attracted many immigrants from Ireland, Germany, Sweden, England, Italy, Portugal, Cape Verde, and French Canada. Economic and demographic shifts caused social strife, notably with a series of race riots between whites and blacks during the 1820s. In response to these troubles and the economic growth, Providence residents ratified a city charter in 1831 as the population passed 17,000. [ 14 ] During the Civil War , local politics split over slavery as many had ties to Southern cotton. Despite ambivalence concerning the war, the number of military volunteers routinely exceeded quota, and the city's manufacturing proved invaluable to the Union. Postwar, horsecar lines covering the city enabled its growth and Providence thrived with waves of immigrants and land annexations bringing the population from 54,595 in 1865 to 175,597 by 1900. [ 14 ] The city's boom began to wane in the mid-1920s as industries, notably textiles, shut down. Jewelry manufacturing continued to grow, taking up the slack and employing many of the city's new immigrants, coming from Portuguese, Italian, Polish, Lithuanian and Jewish backgrounds. A number of hospitals also opened. The Great Depression hit the city hard, and Providence's downtown was subsequently flooded by the New England Hurricane of 1938 . Though the city received a boost from World War II , this ended with the war. The city saw further decline as a result of nation-wide trends, with the construction of highways and increased suburbanization. [ 14 ] The population would drop by 38% over the next three decades. From the 1950s to the 1980s, Providence was a notorious bastion of organized crime . [ 15 ] The mafia boss Raymond L.S. Patriarca ruled a vast criminal enterprise. People gathering in Waterplace Park , opened in 1994, just before a WaterFire event. On the left can be seen the Waterplace condominiums, constructed 2008. The entire area had been covered in railroad tracks and the river covered with paved bridges over until the late 1980s. The city's "Renaissance" began in the 1970s. From 1975 until 1982, $ 606 million of local and national Community Development funds were invested throughout the city, and the hitherto falling population began to stabilize. In the 1990s, Mayor Vincent Cianci, Jr showcased the city's strength in arts and pushed for further revitalization, ultimately resulting in the uncovering of the city's natural rivers (which had been covered by paved bridges), relocation of a large section of railroad underground, creation of Waterplace Park and river walks along the river's banks, and construction of the Fleet Skating Rink (now the Bank of America Skating Rink) downtown and the 1.4 million ft² Providence Place Mall. [ 14 ] New investment triggered within the city, with new construction including numerous condo projects, hotels, and a new office high-rise all filling in the freed space. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Despite new investment, poverty remains an entrenched problem as it does in most post-industrial New England cities. Approximately 22 percent of the city population lives below the poverty line. [ 10 ] Recent increases in real estate values further exacerbate problems for those at marginal income levels, as Providence had the highest rise in median housing price of any city in the United States from 2004 to 2005. [ 18 ] [ edit ] Geography Downtown Providence and the East Side , 2010. Note the demolition of the previous I195 as part of the Iway project. The Providence city limits enclose a small geographic region, with a total area of 20.5 square miles (53 km 2 ). 18.5 square miles (48 km 2 ) of it is land and the remaining 2.1 square miles (5.4 km 2 ) (roughly 10%) of it is water. Providence is located at the head of Narragansett Bay , with the Providence River running into the bay through the center of the city, [ 19 ] formed by the confluence of the Moshassuck and Woonasquatucket Rivers. The Waterplace Park amphitheater and riverwalks line the river's banks through downtown . Providence is one of many cities claimed, like Rome , to be founded on seven hills . The more prominent hills are: Constitution Hill (near downtown), College Hill (east of the Providence River), and Federal Hill (west of downtown and is New England's largest Italian district outside of Massachusetts). The other four are: Tockwotten Hill at Fox Point , Smith Hill (where the State House is located), Christian Hill at Hoyle Square (junction of Cranston & Westminster Streets), and Weybosset Hill at the lower end of Weybosset Street, which was leveled in the early 1880s. [ 20 ] [ edit ] Neighborhoods Providence neighborhoods with major highways shown Main article: Neighborhoods in Providence The Providence skyline viewed from College Hill Providence has 25 official neighborhoods, though these neighborhoods are often grouped together and referred to collectively: [ 21 ] [ 22 ] The East Side is a region comprising the neighborhoods of Blackstone , Hope (aka Summit), Mount Hope , College Hill , Wayland, and Fox Point . The Jewelry District describes the area enclosed by I-95, the old I-195, and the Providence River . The city has made efforts to rename this area the Knowledge District to reflect the area's newly developing life sciences and technology-based economy. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] The North End is formed by the combination of the neighborhoods of Charles and Wanskuck . The South Side (or South Providence) consists of the neighborhoods of Elmwood , Lower South Providence , Upper South Providence , and the West End . West Broadway is an officially recognized neighborhood with its own association. It overlaps with the southern half of Federal Hill and the northern part of the West End. [ 25 ] The West Side is a vague term sometimes used to mean the West End , Olneyville , Silver Lake , and nearby parts of abutting neighborhoods. [ edit ] Cityscape Perspective of Westminster Street Downtown Providence at Burnside Park See also: List of tallest buildings in Providence The city of Providence is geographically very compact, characteristic of eastern seaboard cities which developed prior to use of the automobile. It is among the most densely populated cities in the country . For this reason, Providence has the eighth-highest percentage of pedestrian commuters. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] The street layout is irregular—over one thousand streets (a great number for the city's size) run haphazardly, connecting and radiating from traditionally bustling places like Market Square . [ 28 ] Downtown Providence has numerous 19th century mercantile buildings in the Federal and Victorian architectural styles, as well as several post-modern and modernist buildings, located throughout the area. In particular, a fairly clear spatial separation appears between the areas of pre-1980s development and post-1980s development. West Exchange Street and Exchange Terrace serve as rough boundaries between the two. The newer area, sometimes called "Capitol Center", [ 29 ] includes Providence Place Mall (1999), a Westin hotel (1993) and The Residences at the Westin (2007), GTECH (2006), Waterplace condominiums (2007), and Waterplace Park (1994); the area tends toward newer development since much of it is land reclaimed in the 1970s from a mass of railroad tracks which was referred to colloquially as the "Chinese Wall". [ 30 ] This part of Downtown is characterized by open spaces, wide roads, and intent landscaping. The historic part of downtown has many streetscapes that look as they did eighty years ago. Many of the state's tallest buildings are found here. The largest structure , to date, is the art-deco-styled former Industrial Trust Tower, currently the Bank of America Building at 426 feet (130 m). [ 31 ] By contrast, nearby to it is the second tallest One Financial Plaza , designed in modern taut-skin cladding, constructed a half century later. [ 32 ] In between the two is 50 Kennedy Plaza . The Textron Tower is also a core building to the modest Providence skyline. Downtown is also the home of the Providence Biltmore and Westminster Arcade , the oldest enclosed shopping mall in the U.S., built in 1828. [ 33 ] The city's southern waterfront, away from the downtown core, is the location of many oil tanks, a docking station for a ferry boat, a non-profit sailing center, bars, strip clubs, and power plants. The Russian Submarine Museum was located here until 2008, after the submarine sank in a storm and was declared a loss. The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier is also found here, built to protect Providence from storm surge , like that which it had endured in the 1938 New England Hurricane and again in 1954 from Hurricane Carol . [ 34 ] The majority of the cityscape comprises abandoned and revitalized industrial mills, double and triple decker housing (though the row houses found so commonly in other Northeast cities, are notably rare here), [ 35 ] a small number of high-rise buildings (predominantly for housing the elderly), and single family homes. I-95 serves as a physical barrier between the city's commercial core and neighborhoods such as Federal Hill and the West End . [ edit ] Climate Waterplace Park Providence's climate is a humid continental climate , with warm summers, cold winters, and high humidity year-round. The USDA rates the city at Zone 6a, which is an "in-between" climate. The influence of the Atlantic Ocean keeps Providence, and the rest of the state of Rhode Island, [ 36 ] warmer than many inland locales in New England. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] January is the coldest month with a mean of 28.7 °F (−1.8 °C) . [ 39 ] July is the warmest month with an average of 73.3 °F (22.9 °C) , with highs rising to 90 °F (32 °C) on 10 days per summer. [ 39 ] Extremes range from −17 °F (−27 °C) in February 1934 to 104 °F (40 °C) in August 1975. [ 40 ] As with the rest of the northeastern seaboard, Providence receives ample precipitation year-round. Monthly precipitation ranges from a high of 4.43 inches (112.5 mm) in March to a low of 3.17 inches (80.5 mm) in July. [ 40 ] Precipitation levels are generally slightly lesser in the summer months than the winter months, when powerful storms known as Nor'easters can cause significant snowfall and blizzard conditions. Although hurricanes are not frequent in coastal New England , Providence's location at the head of Narragansett Bay makes it vulnerable to them.

[ 42 ] Annual Estimates of the Population for Incorporated Places Over 100,000. [ 43 ] As of the census [ 1 ] of 2000, the population comprised 173,618 people, 162,389 households, and 35,859 families. [ 44 ] The population density was 9,401.7 inhabitants per square mile (3,629.4/km²), characteristic of comparatively older cities in New England such as New Haven , Connecticut ; Springfield , Massachusetts and Hartford , Connecticut . [ 45 ] Also like these cities, its population peaked in the 1940s just prior to the nationwide period of rapid suburbanization . Providence has had a substantial Italian population since the turn of the century, with 14% (a plurality c[›] ) of the population claiming Italian ancestry. [ 46 ] Italian influence manifests itself in Providence's Little Italy in Federal Hill . [ 47 ] Irish immigrants have also had considerable influence on the city's history, with 8% of residents claiming Irish heritage. [ 48 ] Belying Providence's traditionally white makeup is the sizable minority presence it has acquired in the last twenty years, embodied in the election of its first Latino mayor in 2010, Dominican-American Angel Taveras. Though nearby cities like Boston, Hartford, New Haven, and Springfield have longer-standing black and Latino communities, Providence now surpasses all of them in the density of its minority population, with non-Hispanic whites comprising less than half (40.9%) of the population. [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Though salient contributions to this growth have been among Asians and unspecified races, the most dramatic change comes from Hispanics, whose presence has increased fivefold. Having origins in Puerto Rico , Colombia , Bolivia , the Dominican Republic , and Central America (particularly Guatemala ), Hispanics have strong influence in the neighborhoods of Elmwood , the West End , Upper , and Lower South Providence . [ 50 ] Hispanic impact is even larger in the city's schools. Hispanics represent over half (55%) of all students in the city's school system while comprising only 33% [ 51 ] of Providence's population. [ 49 ] [ 52 ] In addition, Providence, like the nearby Massachusetts cities of Fall River and New Bedford , has a considerable community of immigrants from various Portuguese-speaking countries , living mostly in the areas of Washington Park and Fox Point . [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] Portuguese is the city's third-largest nationality, (after Italian and Irish) at 4% of the population while Cape Verdeans make up another 2%. [ 46 ] African Americans constitute approximately 30% [ 51 ] of the city with the largest percentages in Mount Hope and Upper and Lower South Providence neighborhoods. [ 44 ] [ 56 ] Asians are 6% of Providence's population and have enclaves scattered throughout the city. [ 56 ] Another 6% of the city has multiracial ancestry. Native Americans and Pacific Islanders make up the remaining 1.3%. [ 44 ] With Liberians comprising 0.4% of the population, [ 46 ] the city is home to one of the largest Liberian immigrant populations in the country. [ 57 ] The Providence metropolitan area , which includes Providence, Fall River , Massachusetts , and Warwick is estimated to be 1,622,520. [ 4 ] In 2006, this area was officially added to the Boston Combined Statistical Area (CSA), the fifth-largest CSA in the country . In the last fifteen years, Providence has experienced a sizable growth in its under-18 population, attributed to the influx of Hispanics. [ 49 ] The median age of the city is 28 years, while the largest age cohort is 20 to 24 year olds, owing to the city's large student population. [ 49 ] [ 58 ] The per capita income , as of the 2000 census , was $15,525, which is well below both the state average of $29,113, [ 59 ] and the national average of $21,587. [ 44 ] [ 60 ] The median income for a household was $26,867, and the median income for a family in Providence was $32,058, according to the 2000 census. The city has one of the highest rates of poverty in the nation with 29.1% of the population and 23.9% of families living below the poverty line in 2000, the largest concentrations being found in the city's Olneyville , and Upper and Lower South Providence areas. [ 10 ] [ 61 ] Poverty has affected children at a disproportionately higher rate with 40.1% of those under the age of 18 living below the poverty line, concentrated particularly west of downtown in the neighborhoods of Hartford , Federal Hill , and Olneyville. [ 61 ] [ edit ] Crime Compared to the national average, Providence has a high rate of property crime and an average rate of violent crime per 100,000 inhabitants. [ 62 ] In 2010, there were 15 murders, down from 2009's 24. [ 63 ] In 2010, Providence fared better regarding violent crime than most of its peer cities: Springfield, Massachusetts , a city with approximately 20,000 fewer residents than Providence, reported 15 murders in 2009 (i.e. the same number of homicides as Providence, but a slightly higher rate per capita); [ 64 ] New Haven, Connecticut and Hartford, Connecticut , cities with approximately 50,000 fewer people than Providence, reported, respectively, 24 and 26 murders in 2010, significantly higher murder rates per capita than Providence. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] The police chief asserted that Providence's violence was not stranger-to-stranger, but relationship driven. [ 67 ] The pattern of violent crime was highly specific by neighborhood with vast majority of the murders taking place in the poorer sections of Providence, such as Olneyville , Elmwood , South Providence and the West End . [ 68 ] Providence has the fifth-highest rate of property crime per 100,000 inhabitants in the country. [ 69 ] Burglary and car theft, in particular constitute 1.1 and 2.5 times the national average. [ 62 ] [ edit ] Economy Providence was one of the first cities to industrialize in the United States. By 1830, the city had manufacturing industries in metals, machinery, textiles, jewelry, and silverware. Though manufacturing has declined, the city is still one of the largest centers for jewelry and silverware design and manufacturing. Services, particularly education, health care, and finance, also make up a large portion of the city's economy. Providence also is the site of a sectional center facility , a regional hub for the U.S. Postal Service. [ 70 ] Since it is the capital of Rhode Island, Providence's economy additionally consists of government services. Over one third of Providence's economy is based in either trade, transportation, and utilities, or educational and health services. [ 71 ] Textron's headquarters , One Financial Plaza , and the Rhode Island Hospital Trust building The Fortune 500 conglomerate Textron and Fortune 1000 company Nortek Incorporated are both headquartered in the city, and GTECH 's world headquarters has recently been moved to downtown Providence. [ 72 ] Citizens Bank , the 15th largest bank in the country, [ 73 ] is also headquartered in Providence. [ 74 ] Another company whose origins were in the city is Fleet Bank . Once Rhode Island's largest bank, it moved its headquarters to Boston , Massachusetts , after acquiring Shawmut Bank in 1995. Before its acquisition by Bank of America , Fleet merged with BankBoston to become New England's largest commercial bank. The city is home to the Rhode Island Convention Center, which opened in December 1993. [ 75 ] Along with a hotel, the convention center is connected to the Providence Place Mall , a major retail center, through a skywalk . [ 75 ] The Port of Providence, the second largest deepwater seaport in New England, [ 76 ] handles cargo such as cement, chemicals, heavy machinery, petroleum, and scrap metal. [ 77 ] [ edit ] Top employers According to the City's 2009 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, [ 78 ] the top ten employers in the city are: # Employer # of Employees % of Total city employment 1 Rhode Island Hospital 6,910 6.17 2 Brown University 4,877 4.36 3 Bank of America 3,040 2.72 4 Women & Infants Hospital 2,880 2.57 5 Miriam Hospital 2,389 2.13 6 Roger Williams Medical Center 1,470 1.31 7 Citizens Bank 1,289 1.15 8 Verizon 1,205 1.08 9 Johnson & Wales University 1,200 1.07 10 Pinkerton 1,167 1.04 [ edit ] Government Providence City Hall in the Second Empire Baroque style Rhode Island State House at sunset Providence serves as Rhode Island's capital, housing the Rhode Island General Assembly as well as the offices of the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor in the Rhode Island State House . Providence's city government has a mayor-council form of government. The Providence City Council consists of fifteen city councilors, one for each of the city's wards. The council is tasked with enacting ordinances and passing an annual budget. Providence also has probate and superior courts. The U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island is located downtown across from City Hall adjacent to Kennedy Plaza . David N. Cicilline finished his term as mayor in 2010, 8 years after taking office as the first openly gay mayor of an American state capital. [ 79 ] (notably, the second was elected 8 years later in neighboring Hartford, Connecticut .

F. Green Airport in nearby Warwick . General aviation fields also serve the region. Because of overcrowding and Big Dig complications in Boston, Massport has been promoting T.F. Green as an alternative to Boston's Logan International Airport . [ 125 ] Providence Station , located between the Rhode Island State House and the downtown district, is served by Amtrak [ 126 ] and MBTA Commuter Rail services, with a commuter rail route running north to Boston and south to a recently opened station at T.F.

I-295 encircles Providence while RI 146 provides a direct connection with Worcester , Massachusetts . The city has commissioned and begun a long-term project, the Iway , to move I-195 not only for safety reasons, but also to free up land and to reunify the Jewelry District with Downcity Providence, which had been split from one another by the highway. [ 131 ] The project is estimated to cost $446 million and be completed in 2012. [ 132 ] Kennedy Plaza , in downtown Providence, serves as a transportation hub for local public transit as well as a departure point for Peter Pan [ 133 ] and Greyhound [ 134 ] bus lines.

This is because in all the New England states, city status is conferred by the form of government, not population. Providence retained the title of ninth-largest settlement until the Census of 1810. ^ c: "Other" is the largest nationality group. Italian is the largest nationality by descendancy for a specified country. ^ d: Figure includes Hasbro Children's Hospital as part of Rhode Island Hospital.
